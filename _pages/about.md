We develop methodologies to build software systems that are both resource efficient (CPU, memory, energy) and adequate with modern software development techniques. We push further the frontier knowledge of Software Engineering with innovative, rigorous empirical evaluation, and valuable software artifacts. We regularly contribute to open source ecosystems and corporate software systems. 

**Our mission includes:**
* Research and develop techniques to make software efficient, eco-friendly, and less resource consuming. To meet these objectives we employ deep learning techniques, empirical studies, and data visualizations.
* Improving the development of software systems for resource intensive systems and robotics systems.
* Preparing students to leading position in software industry and academia.
